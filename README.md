# 🌸 BloomBack

> Send digital flower bouquets that plant real trees. Create lasting memories instead of temporary gifts.

## What is BloomBack?

BloomBack is a web app that lets you send beautiful animated digital bouquets to loved ones. Instead of buying flowers that wilt in 3 days, each bloom you send plants a real tree and creates a shared memory page where both of you can watch your tree grow over time.
